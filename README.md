Source code for my final project in the university. The theme was _Computer game application in the genre of detective with elements of psychological horror_

<br/>

_Margareth Weiss is an ambitious detective. Having received the position at a relatively young age, she is ready to do anything to realize her career dreams and become a perfect example of law enforcement. Among her colleagues, she has already gained a good reputation for her deductive skills and unconventional approach to investigation. But in order to gain recognition not only among her colleagues, but also from higher positions, Margareth decided to solve one of the old cases that had been closed before due to a lack of evidence. She did not know at the time that if she took the case of a maniac who kidnapped children, she would be in trouble and she would have to apply all her knowledge and skills not only to solve the case... but also to survive._
_Trials, puzzles, survival, fear for life and the spiral of madness are just the beginning of the main character’s difficult journey. And how her story ends, whether she survives or not, will depend on her alone._

The project represents a  computer game application in the genre Detective with elements of Psychological Horror. It was developed using the Unity engine and the object-oriented programming language C#. The shaders using in the project were written in the ShaderLab language.

The game was built on the strengths of already existing games of selected genres.

The main idea while designing the game was the idea of interaction between the real and the otherworld. Developed the case that could be solved by interacting with the ghosts of innocent victims who have become involuntary witnesses to a series of terrible accidents.

In order to create the necessary atmosphere in the game and skillfully serve the developed plot, a visual component was implemented and sounds were selected from public sources (https://pixabay.com/). Preference was given to unsaturated and dark color schemes and sharp sounds to create a gloomy, depressing atmosphere. The game sprites for the characters were depicted in a cartoon-ish style in order to attract more interest among young people. The visual component of the game was entirely developed by me.

The developed computer game application implements key mechanics of selected genres, allowing the player to dive into the investigation and feel like a detective, thinking about unraveling a difficult case in the tense environment of a dark house with ghosts.

<br/>

Main mechanics presented in the game:

- mechanic of entering evidence and clues in the detective diary
- mechanics of changing the value of the mental scale during interaction with paranormal phenomena around
- flashlight mechanic
- evidence combining mechanic
- item combining mechanic
- mechanic of talking with a ghost
